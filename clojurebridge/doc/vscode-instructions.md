# VSCode Instructions

## Get the materials

1. Go to `https://github.com/clojurebridgefi/clojurebridge22-materials`, and click the green button saying "Code". Select "Download ZIP".
2. Unzip the clojurebridge22-materials.zip
3. In Visual Studio Code, select File -> Open folder. Find the materials you just unzipped and select the "clojurebridge22-materials-main"-folder.
4. VSCode might ask for a permission to access the folder.
4. You might see a notification about whether you trust the authors of the files. Say you trust them, it's us :)

## Open the first file and start the REPL!

1. On the left you will see a project called clojurebridge. Click it open, then select src → clojurebridge → basics.clj
2. Start the repl with two key combinations: Ctrl + Option + c and then Ctrl + Option + j.
3. If you're prompted to select from two projects, select the one that ends with clojurebridge.
4. From the project type selection pick Leiningen, and then for the profiles to lauch with, just click Ok (no überjar).
5. You should see the repl on the right side, telling "Jack-in done". If not, ask for help from a coach.
